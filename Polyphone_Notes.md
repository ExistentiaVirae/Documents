### Getting Polyphone

Polyphone is available from [davy7125](https://github.com/davy7125/polyphone) or [the Polyphone site](http://polyphone-soundfonts.com/en/).

### Samples Section

* Click the sine-wave icon on the toolbar or drag samples onto the left side of the window.
* Length of file names is limited, so put the most significant portions at the beginning.
* In the waveform display: 
   * left-click to set the loop beginning, right-click to set loop end
   * left-click-and-drag moves the waveform display when it does not fit
   * right-click-and-drag to zoom in or out, vertically and/or horizontally
   * when zoomed in sufficiently, loop points will have a portion of the wave around the other loop-point visible, allowing easier matching to avoid clicks during playback

### Instruments Section

* Key Range row is for the MIDI note numbers a sample is assigned to (another reason to give samples meaningful and distinct names)
   * can be individual notes or a range with a dash e.g. 0-59 or 60-127
* Panning is from -50 to 50, usually set automatically when adding samples to the instrument
* Loop Playback offers three options by double-clicking the cell
* all cells can be copied and pasted
* __NOTE__: if you find that there is an octave gap between samples, like the B is an octave below the C adjacent to it, change the "Root Key" from 60 to 48. Do *not* try to use the "Tuning (Semi-tones)" row, as not all players support that tag yet.

### Presets Section

* if adding more than one instrument, they should not cover overlapping note ranges
